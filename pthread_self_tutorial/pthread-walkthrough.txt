We are going to start with 

man pthread <-

Learn
    pthread_create
    pthread_join
    pthread_self
    pthread_mutex_init
    pthread_mutex_destroy
    pthread_mutex_(Un)lock
    pthread_cond^
    pthread_cond_signal
    pthread_cond_broadcast
    
    FOR ALL PROGRAMS, CREATE A TIMER SO THAT WE CAN TEST THREADED VS NON-THREADED

    Create a threaded program that prints out "hello world" without ANY errors
    or memory leaks... The program is initally helworlod.c . Make it run three threads of the printHello
    instance so that it still prints out 300 hello worlds.

    Create a threaded program that calculates the fib sequence.

    Implement fizzbuzz using cond_broadcast at least once.
